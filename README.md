# School-Projects
These are some of my projects I have created at my university during my first semester.

MultiArrays.java is a program that takes in user input of the size of the array and creates a 2D and 3D array based on those values. 
The program will identify the largest value in the 2D array and the longest row in the 3D array.

PatternsChoice.java is a fun program that prints out the rows of a 2D array in differnt patterns that form pyramids. The style pyramid is chosen by what the user enters.
There are 4 different patterns to choose from.

Statistics.java is a small program that deals creating an array with random elements with the length being determined by the user. Then finds the mean, median, mode, and range.

TicTacToe.java is a game of tictactoe that can be played with 2 players. The game has a board containing numbers 1-9 to represent the spots where O's and X's can go.
The user picks what number they want their letter to go to and is played like normal tictactoe. The system will detect horizontal, diagonal, and vertical wins.

VWFull.java is short for Virtual Wallet which is a small simulation to how a transaction app would operate. You can input a name to give or take money from as long as you have a balance over $0.

WhatDay.java is a program that can find what day of the week a date fell on. The user enters a month, day, and year between 1700-2300 and will be able to find the day of the week.
